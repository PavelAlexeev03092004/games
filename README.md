## TIC-TAC-TOE
  Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where the objective is to form a line of three of your symbols (either "X" or "O") on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns placing their symbol in an empty cell, and the game ends when one player successfully forms a line or the grid is filled without a winner (resulting in a draw). The players can win by having three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). 
## Gallows
 The Gallows game is a word-guessing game where computer thinks of a word, and the other player tries to guess it letter by letter. The word is initially represented by blanks for each letter, and the player attempting to guess suggests letters one at a time. If a guessed letter is in the word, the blanks are filled in with that letter; if not, a part of a stick figure (representing a person on a gallows) is drawn. The player must guess the word before the entire stick figure is drawn, or they lose the game.
